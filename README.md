# microsoft_movies

## Description
The project was carried out to determine the various movie/films types that microsoft as a company should create. despite this the company is unable to do this due to the inadequacy of the knowledge about movies. I have looked at two datasets that is bom_movie gross and the im.db to bring out the picture that will help the company to see clearly what types of films to create and how this will improve the company interms of revenue.


## Findings
To investigate this , we found out that;
The mean of the foreign gross was greater tha the mean of the domestic gross.
The median of the foreign gross was also greater than that of the domestic gross.
The median of the movie_rating_basics is greater than that of its mean.
